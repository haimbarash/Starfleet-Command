# Starfleet-Command
This repository showcases the implementation of an object-oriented software design approach to manage a futuristic space fleet.
It utilizes the principles of inheritance, abstraction and interfaces to define the various classes that represent the crew members and different types of spaceships in the fleet.
The objects of these classes are then used to generate useful reports about the fleet such as the total maintenance cost, total firepower of the spaceships and other relevant information.
This project provides an exercise in software design, utilizing key concepts to build a functional system.

In addition to the implementation of the object-oriented design, this repository also showcases the use of object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation and polymorphism.
The classes are designed in a way that encapsulates the relevant information and behavior, making it easy to manage and manipulate the data.
The polymorphic behavior of the classes is demonstrated through the ability to override methods in subclasses, providing a tailored implementation for each specific type of spaceship.
This project not only provides a hands-on experience in software design, but also highlights the importance of following best practices in object-oriented programming.
